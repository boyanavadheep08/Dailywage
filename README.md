# AI Prompt Usage – LabourConnect

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (for architecture, UI logic, voice integration)
- GitHub Copilot (optional, if used)

## Prompt Strategy
We used AI to:
- Design user flows for illiterate daily wage workers
- Simplify UI language
- Integrate voice assistance
- Debug frontend and backend setup issues

## Sample Prompts Used

1. "Design a web app for daily wage workers who cannot read, using voice assistance."
2. "Create a clean React + Tailwind landing page for a labour hiring platform."
3. "Explain how to integrate text-to-speech in a React web app."
4. "Help structure frontend and backend separately for a hackathon project."
5. "Fix errors while setting up Vite + Tailwind + shadcn UI."

AI was used as a development assistant, not to generate final decisions.
